Hymnal_library

This is a barely legal project, but we don't talk about that


To compile on your device, cd into secretstash and then 

do 

pip install -r requirements.txt

then 

python manage.py runserver 

to run the app


We also just switched to postgres, so you need to launch and connect to that
on your own instance

dbname: dbtest
username: postgres 
password: password
